ok so the steps we want to be working so we have a working game are:

# open a  window ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
install the library and compiler to work.

# init engine and files
we want to create an instance of the engine on runtime and save files on disk
ok so that includes:
    #scenes
        ill use circles to render stuff for now
    #sprites(pngs)
    #

# run a main menu 

# create a UI api for the game

# Make a game scene run
